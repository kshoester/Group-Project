To highlight what areas need most attention in terms of promoting active transportation, while putting it in
context of Toronto's active transportation infrastrucutre. The index in particular can give policymakers a better
idea of which areas are over / underpreforming in terms of active transportation relative to that neighbourhood's
unique attributes.
